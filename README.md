# PHP Salesforce Lead Creator
This is some code that we ported from various resources online and used on DocumentLeads

## General Requirements

* You'll need SOAP installed.
* A Salesforce.com Trial Account to test with

The Salesforce toolkit was downloaded from here: https://github.com/developerforce/Force.com-Toolkit-for-PHP 

Note: I've documented each step within the code. There are a lot of links to resources within the code. Hopefully this saves someone from having the same trouble I did finding the stuff...
